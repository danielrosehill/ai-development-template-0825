# AI Development Template (Aug 2025 Iteration)

 This repository is an update of my previous template for AI-assisted development. 
 
 This folder structure, or scaffold, is designed for templated repository generation with agentic code editors such as GitHub, Copilot, Windsurf, Continue, or any of the other emerging tools. 
 
 The basic structure is divided between instructions **to** AI and **from** AI (to human!), with markdown documents providing the instructions. 
 
 The memory and log folder is intended to provide a place for AI tools to write out logs to ensure continuity of context across multiple editing sessions (this 'feature' has been supplanted by graph-based memory preservation modules but can provide a simple and human-readable alternative if desired). 
 
The "for AI" folder is structured with the idea that it can provide folders to hold additional pieces of context that might be useful in iterative editing or in debugging, such as log files.

This particular iteration was developed to provide a scaffold for use with my 'Quick Repo' CLI - a no-fuss CLI for creating Github (and Hugging Face) repositories.

## Repository Structure

### `for-ai/` - Input to AI Agent
This folder contains all the context, instructions, and information you provide to the AI agent:

- **`prompts/`** - Development prompts and instructions
  - `initial-development.md` - Project kickoff requirements
  - `iteration-template.md` - Template for session-specific instructions
- **`context/`** - Project context and background information
- **`debugging/`** - Error logs and debugging information
- **`logs/`** - Application logs and runtime information
- **`specifications/`** - Feature specifications and requirements
- **`examples/`** - Code examples and reference implementations

### `from-ai/` - Output from AI Agent
This folder contains documentation and logs generated by the AI agent:

- **`session-logs/`** - Detailed logs of each development session
- **`documentation/`** - Setup guides, architecture docs, and maintenance instructions
- **`notes/`** - AI-generated explanations and technical notes
- **`procedures/`** - Step-by-step procedures and workflows

## How to Use This Template

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Clone this template repository
2. Update the project-specific information in `for-ai/context/project-context.md`
3. Fill out `for-ai/prompts/initial-development.md` with your project requirements

### 2. Development Sessions
1. **Before each session:** Update `for-ai/prompts/iteration-template.md` with specific goals
2. **During development:** The AI agent will work from your instructions and context
3. **After each session:** Review the generated session log in `from-ai/session-logs/`

### 3. Maintaining Context
- Add debugging information to `for-ai/debugging/`
- Update project context as the codebase evolves
- Keep specifications current in `for-ai/specifications/`
